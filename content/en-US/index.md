Hi there! We are Blossom Selves, our team members are mainly from Mainland China and Taiwan, and our partner is One Among Us, which is dedicated to building a warm supportive community and companion network for trans and gender diverse friends.

Our journey began with “[Blossom Like You](https://bloom.blsv.org/)” - a meditation series for transgender women that focuses on compassionate care and self-identity. It is a gentle harbor for nourishment and growth, and a guide for more people to meet in beauty.

We are a community-contributing non-profit organization.
